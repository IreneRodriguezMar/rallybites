## Tech Stack

List major technologies used:

| Layer | Technology / Library |
|---|---|
| Platform / Runtime | Node.js / Deno / Python / ‚Ä¶ |
| Framework / Libraries | Express, React, Vue, etc. |
| APIs / Integrations | Rally REST API, database connectors, etc. |

## Architecture & Design

Explain how the system is organized, module breakdowns, high‚Äëlevel flow, etc.  
You can include:

- Directory structure  
- Data flow diagrams / sequence diagrams (if any)  
- Key modules and their responsibilities  
- How components interact (API ‚Üí service ‚Üí data)  
- Error handling, concurrency, caching, etc.  

> Example: ‚ÄúThe core `src/api` handles HTTP requests, which delegate to service classes in `src/services`, which in turn talk to the data layer in `src/models`.‚Äù

If you have any architecture diagrams, you can embed them:
